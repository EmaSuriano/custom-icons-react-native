# custom-icons-react-native

This is an example of how to load custom icons into react native without the need to use 3rd party services as Fontello or Icomoon. The icons I choose for the example can be found inside [FlatIcon](https://www.flaticon.com/packs/landmarks-and-monuments-18).

<!-- I wrote an article explaining how it works and the advantages/disadvantages of this approach in case you want to know more.  -->
